Hello!
My name is Evyatar Shaked, and I’ve recently joined the Weizmann Institute of Science as an M.Sc. student in Computational Biology track. I’m currently doing my first rotation in the Milo Lab.

I hold a B.Sc. in Plant Science and Biotechnology from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and I have hands-on experience in both molecular biology techniques and data analysis.

# Milo lab
At the Milo Lab, we harness rational design and adaptive lab evolution to find solutions for sustainable energy sources.

I’m currently working on a project focused on expressing different enzymes to enhance the growth of autotrophic E. coli. The main type of data I generate consists of growth curves of various E. coli strains under different experimental conditions.
